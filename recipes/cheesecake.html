            <li>sweetened whipped cream for serving</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) with rack in lower third position.Lightly grease an 8-inch springform pan with cooking spray and line with parchment on the bottom.</p></li>
            <li><p>Process cookies in a food processor until ground into small crumbs, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour in melted butter and process for another 30 seconds.</p></li>
            <li><p>Press evenly into bottom and about 1 inch up sides of prepared pan.</p></li>
            <li><p>Bake in the preheated oven until firm and fragrant, 10 to 12 minutes. Let cool slightly while making the filling, about 10 minutes.</p></li>
            <li><p>Reduce oven temperature to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).</p></li>
            <li><p>Once crust is cooled, wrap bottom of pan with 2 layers of heavy-duty aluminum foil to prevent water from seeping into pan.</p></li>
            <li><p>To make the cheesecake filling: Add cream cheese to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and beat on medium-low speed until creamy, about 2 minutes. Add sour cream, and beat on medium-low speed until fully combined, scraping down sides of bowl halfway through, about 2 minutes.</p></li>
            <li><p>Beat in sugar, espresso powder, vanilla, and salt, until combined, scraping down the sides of the bowl halfway through, about 1 minute. Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating on low speed just until combined after each addition and scraping down sides of bowl with a rubber spatula, 1 to 2 minutes.</p></li>
            <li><p>Add Baileys and beat on low speed until just combined, about 45 seconds.</p></li>
            <li><p>Pour filling onto cooled crust. Place springform pan into a larger roasting pan and place in preheated oven. Pour 1 1/2 cups of water in roasting pan and bake until the cheesecake is almost set (the center 2 inches should jiggle slightly) and edges have pulled away slightly from pan, 50 to 60 minutes.</p></li>
            <li><p>Turn off oven and leave door cracked open about 7 to 8 inches; let cheesecake stand in oven 30 minutes. Remove from oven and carefully lift cheesecake from water bath. Cover and chill at least 3 hours or overnight.</p></li>
            <li><p>To make the ganache: Heat cream and Baileys in a small saucepan over medium heat until warm to the touch, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in espresso powder until fully combined. Add chocolate chips and let stand 1 minute; stir until smooth.</p></li>
            <li><p>Remove cheesecake from pan and place on a cake plate. Pour ganache evenly over chilled cheesecake, spreading slightly over edges with an offset spatula. Refrigerate until ganache is firm, about 30 minutes.</p></li>
        </ol>
